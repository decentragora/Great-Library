## Step 1â€“ [Getting Metamask](https://github.com/gentlemensbank/info/blob/main/how-to-nfts-rarible.md#getting-metamask) (Browser Extension)

Go to [Metamask.io](https://metamask.io/download.html) and download the Metamask extension for your browser.

Then you will need to choose an option. If you already an ETH wallet, you can import it via the seed phrase. If notâ€“ use "Create a wallet." 

In this guide, we assume that you need a new wallet.

Push the "I agree" button to agree to Metamasks terms of service.

Then create a password. It will protect your wallet from people who may accidentally use your computer:

Then create a password. It will protect your wallet from people who may accidentally be at your computer:

On the next page, click the area with a lock. There will be 12 words. **Store the words securely.** Anyone who knows those words will have access to your wallet. The safest way is to write them down on a piece of paper and hide them. 

**I strongly recommend NOT storing this phrase in notes, in the mail, in cloud services.**

On the next page, they will ask you to repeat your seed phrase. Just do it.

Then you will see this window. Use the cross in the top right cornerâ€“ to close it â€“we don't need it right now. (Metamask swap menu)

So, congratulations, now you have an ETH wallet with Metamask extension. Now click on your address to copy it to your clipboard.

## Stage 2â€“ [Send ETH to your Metamask wallet](https://github.com/gentlemensbank/info/blob/main/how-to-nfts-rarible.md#funding-metamask)

You need to send ETH from your crypto-exchange, exchanger or another wallet you own to your new address in Metamask. I'm unsure how you buy ETH. 

>You can look at Google how to send ETH in the individual case.
 
To fund your Metamask. You will send ETH to yourselfâ€“ use the address that you copied in the previous step. Double-check to make sure they are the same, and it was copied correctly by comparing the first and last characters. 

> at least three characters from both sides of your addressâ€“ not including 0x.

Wait for the ETH to arrive. Transfers usually take anywhere from 3-10 minutes. Sending ETH varies depending on the load of the Ethereum network. And the gas price you selected when sending can drastically increase your wait time. (if you had an option)


## Step 3â€“ [Connect your Metamask to Rarible.com](https://github.com/gentlemensbank/info/blob/main/how-to-nfts-rarible.md#connecting-to-rarible)
Now go to https://rarible.com/ and click to "Connect wallet" in the top right corner.

Choose "Metamask"

*If it's Metamask is not installed, go to the first step. Rarible does not display Metamask by default.*

[picture]

Then you will see a Metamask pop-up window. Metamask is asking your permission to connect to Rarible.com. Click Next.

And one more time.

Click then checkbox's and then proceed.

So, now you have an account on Rarible, and you're ready to mint your first NFT.


## Step 4â€“ [How to create NFT & the GAS fees](https://github.com/gentlemensbank/info/blob/main/how-to-nfts-rarible.md#create-nft-gas-fees)

Click the "Create" button on Rarible.com 

Then you will have a choice: 
Single NFT â€“ 1 copy (ERC-721) 
Multiple NFTsâ€“ 1 or more (ERC-1155)
You can check the actual minting price here: https://raribleanalytics.com/

Then you will upload your file to IPFS.

**Important thing: if you upload the video, you will see one more upload area below. This area is for the cover.  If you leave it empty, your preview will be static. For a dynamic preview, you need to upload a gif file.**

Put on saleâ€“ if you want to mint now, but put it on sale laterâ€“ switch it off. 

Instant sale priceâ€“ keep it off if you want an auction. Set the toggle to 'on' for instant sale at your set price. You can change it later (from auction to instant or vice versa) 

However, to make sale adjustments, you have to select the "remove from sale" option. (about 10-20 USD depending on GWEI)

Unlock once purchasedâ€“ use it for additional content. Buyer exclusives etc. 

>For example, additional images with better resolution. Physical component or a video.

Scroll down.

ðŸ’°Royalties - how many percent you will be get from reselling your NFT. You will receive them on every resale. 

Number of copies - It depends on you, you can put a low price and more copies, in my opinion this increases the likelihood of a purchase. This is especially important for new artists as a promotion method.

Click the "Create" button. Metamask will offer you to sign the transaction for Approving your wallet. It's will be only once for ERC-721 and one time for ERC-1155 then you will be pay fee only for mint. There is a blue EDIT button above the amount. By clicking it, you will see options for sending a transaction. The speed of its confirmation depends on the amount of the fee. I usually choose Average or Fast (if I don't feel like waiting). Important: please do not try to set up the commission yourself if you have no experience. This can lead to the fact that your transaction will take a very long time or not be processed at all.
Push to "Confirm".

So, when your transaction confirms you get notified.

Push "Start" âœ…

[picture]

Now Metamask will be ask you about pay minting fee. If you don't like actual price, you can waiting. Just check https://raribleanalytics.com/ (you need ERC-721 mint price or ERC-1155 mint price, it depends on whether you are creating a single or multiple item.). You can use "Alert me by email" option.

So, for the transaction fee it's same situation like and with approval wallet transaction - just click EDIT and choose what you want.
Then click to confirm.

Congratulation! You win! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰âœ…
