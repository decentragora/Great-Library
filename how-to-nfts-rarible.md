## Step 1â€“ Getting Metamask (Browser Extension)

Go to [Metamask.io](https://metamask.io/download.html) and download the Metamask extension for your browser.

Then you will need to choose an option. If you already an ETH wallet, you can import it via the seed phrase. 

**If notâ€“ use "Create a wallet."** 

In this guide, we assume that you need a new wallet.


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/93add0fa7d162a8a513db.png" alt="new-to-metamask" width="75%" height="50%">



Push the "I agree" button to agree to Metamasks terms of service.


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/fb1e03d1bff81dfc4930d.png" alt="terms-of-service" width="50%" height="25%">

Then create a password. It will protect your wallet from people who may accidentally use your computer:

<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/408c98ff17be6b360a70b.png" alt="creating-password" width="50%" height="25%">

On the next page, click the area with a lock. There will be 12 words. **Store the words securely.** Anyone who knows those words will have access to your wallet. The safest way is to write them down on a piece of paper and hide them. 

**I strongly recommend NOT storing this phrase in notes, in the mail, in cloud services.**

<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/66467d0224da7784da899.png" alt="seed-phrase" width="75%" height="50%">

On the next page, they will ask you to repeat your seed phrase. Just do it.

Then you will see this window. Use the cross in the top right cornerâ€“ to close it â€“we don't need it right now. (Metamask swap menu)

So, congratulations, now you have an ETH wallet with Metamask extension. 
Now click on your address to copy it to your clipboard.

**(Below Account 1 on my screenshot)**

## Stage 2â€“ Send ETH to your Metamask wallet

You need to send ETH from your crypto-exchange, exchanger or another wallet you own to your new address in Metamask. I'm unsure how you buy ETH. 

> **You can look at Google how to send ETH in the individual case.**
 
To fund your Metamask. You will send ETH to yourselfâ€“ use the address that you copied in the previous step. Double-check to make sure they are the same, and it was copied correctly by comparing the first and last characters. 

> **at least three characters from both sides of your addressâ€“ not including 0x.**

Wait for the ETH to arrive. Transfers usually take anywhere from 3-10 minutes. Sending ETH varies depending on the load of the Ethereum network. And the gas price you selected when sending can drastically increase your wait time. (if you had an option)


## Step 3â€“ Connect your Metamask to Rarible.com


Now go to https://rarible.com/ and click to "Connect wallet" in the top right corner.


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/7bce1048212c943991a37.png" alt="connecting wallet" width="75%" height="50%">


Choose "Metamask"

*If it's Metamask is not installed, go to the first step. Rarible does not display Metamask by default.*


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/cd92396a2b30b5154e829.png" alt="choose metamask" width="50%" height="50%">



Then you will see a Metamask pop-up window. Metamask is asking your permission to connect to Rarible.com. Click Next.



<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/578e52f4d20f464ccdc9c.png" alt="give permission" width="50%" height="50%">



And one more time.


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/4f5f4873d77b2898f1b65.png" alt="proceeding with connection" width="50%" height="50%">


Click then checkbox's and then proceed.


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/2bd0c84d1a4d488f7ec62.png" alt="you are connected" width="75%" height="50%">


So, now you have an account on Rarible, and you're ready to mint your first NFT.


## Step 4â€“ How to create NFT & the GAS fees

Click the "Create" button on Rarible.com 

Then you will have a choice: 
- Single NFT â€“ 1 copy (ERC-721) 
- Multiple NFTsâ€“ 1 or more (ERC-1155)

You can check the actual minting price here: https://raribleanalytics.com/


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/82f0c215ad4d2e1dd9882.png" alt="creating nfts" width="75%" height="50%">


Then you will upload your file to IPFS.

**Important: if you upload the video, you will see one more upload area below. This area is for the cover.  If you leave it empty, your preview will be static. For a dynamic preview, you need to upload a gif file.**

Put on saleâ€“ if you want to mint now, but put it on sale laterâ€“ switch it off. 

Instant sale priceâ€“ keep it off if you want an auction. Set the toggle to 'on' for instant sale at your set price. You can change it later (from auction to instant or vice versa) 

However, to make sale adjustments, you have to select the "remove from sale" option. (about 10-20 USD depending on GWEI)

Unlock once purchasedâ€“ use it for additional content. Buyer exclusives etc. 

>For example, additional images with better resolution. Physical component or a video.

Scroll down.

ðŸ’°Royalties = earnings from your NFTs selling on the secondary market. You will receive them on every resale on Rarible. It's percentage-based.

The amount- depends on you. You can put a low price and more copies. In my opinion, this increases the likelihood of a purchase. 

**This is especially important for new artists as a promotion method.**


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/1377b927e78f2054fb297.png" alt="nft details 2" width="75%" height="50%">


Click the "Create" button. 

Metamask will prompt you to sign the transaction for 'Approving' your wallet. The approval transaction is a one-time feeâ€“ mandatory on the Ethereum network â€“this happens once per contract type. 

It's known asâ€“ Set Approval For All.

This transaction gives the Rarible contract permission to use your wallet to interact with minting contracts.

ERC-721 & ERC-1155 are separate contracts, and both require this approval transaction. After approval, the only cost associated with creation is minting. 

There is a blue EDIT button above the amount. (this allows the gas fee to be adjusted)

After clicking it, you will see options for your transaction. The speed of its confirmation depends on the fee you choose at the time. I typically choose either Average or Fast. (your wallet calculates the cost for you)

To avoid waiting: high gas = fast confirmation. 

> **there is an expense to be the fastest.**

*Important: please do not try to adjust the gas fees yourself if you have no experience. Adjusting the amount after wallet calculation can lead to your transaction pending for longer than you expect. If you are too slow, you also run the risk it is not processed at all.*

Hit "Confirm"


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/a76d540540752961e5494.png" alt="confirming with wallet" width="75%" height="50%">


When your transaction gets confirmed, you get notified.

**noteâ€“ do not navigate away from the page and wait until your previous transaction for 'Approval' is confirmed.**

Push "Start" âœ…


<img src="https://telegra.ph/file/b6c67296658d4a1687e01.png" alt="press start to mint" width="75%" height="50%">


Now Metamask will present you the minting transaction, and you will get asked to pay the gas fee to call the 'mint function.'

If you don't like the current price to send transactions on Ethereum, you can wait. 

To know the costs involved, check https://raribleanalytics.com/ 
(you want the ERC-721 mint price or the ERC-1155 mint priceâ€“ it depends on whether you are creating a single or multiple NFT.)

You can use the "Alert me by email" option.

So, for the transaction feeâ€“ for minting â€“it's the same situation as with an approval transaction. Click EDIT and choose the speed you want. 
(keep in mindâ€“ don't use the cheapest option, unless you can wait)

Then click to confirm.

You can track pending transactions with [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io).

*Do not send additional transactions until both the approval and the minting transaction get confirmed. Transactions get sent one after another, and they confirm in the same way.*

Congratulations! You win! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰âœ…
